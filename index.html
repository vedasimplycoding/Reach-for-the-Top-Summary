<h1>Reach for the Top-Summary</h1>
<h2> Part 1: Santosh Yadav Summary</h2>
<p>Part 1 of Reach for the Top starts with Santosh Yadav, the first woman on Earth who has scaled the mighty Mount Everest twice. The story is a biographical piece about a woman who was born in a patriarchal society that does not offer a warm welcome to a daughter, like a son. She was born in a small village of Joniyawas located at Rewari District in Haryana. She was the sixth child of her family with five elder brothers. Although her parents were wealthy landowners, they were not so inclined to provide quality education to their children in good schools. Rather they chose the local village school for their children’s education. Despite growing up in a controlled environment, Santosh chose to defy the societal norms and carved a niche for herself</p>
<p2>From a young age, she was discriminated against on the basis of gender and decided to fight the system in her own way. When Santosh was sixteen years old, her parents pressurised her to tie the knot, like other girls of her village. But she chose not to give in to their pressure tactics. She told her parents firmly that she wanted to study further and wished to carve a place for herself in the society. Besides, she told them that if they objected she would fund her own education by working part-time jobs. Finally, they agreed to fund her education. Soon after that, she took admission at a school in Delhi and passed the high school examinations. Then she joined the Maharani College in Jaipur and booked a room in the Kasturba Hostel.</p2>
<p>Since then, her life took a new turn when she enrolled in a course at Uttarkashi’s Nehru Institute of Mountaineering and participated in an expedition. Thereafter, every year she continued participating in an expedition to pursue her new dream of mountaineering. Her hard work finally paid off in 1992, when she climbed the mighty Mount Everest when she was barely twenty years old. She became the youngest woman to achieve such a feat and also saved a fellow mountaineer when she shared her oxygen with him. She secured a unique place for India and herself by creating history in mountaineering and scaling it twice in her lifetime. Santosh was awarded one of the highest civilian honours, the Padma Shri by the Indian government for achieving this marvellous feat.</p>
<h3>Part 2: Maria Sharapova Summary</h3>
<p>In Part 2 of Reach for the Top chapter, we learn about the renowned Russian tennis player, Maria Sharapova. This story illustrates her journey of becoming the world champion in women’s tennis. She achieved the number one position through hard labour, extensive rigorous training and several sacrifices on the personal front. In this biography, Maria tells us how she started her tennis training at an early age to reach the summit of women’s tennis when she was barely eighteen years old.</p>
<p>Maria was born in Siberia in Russia and left her home town at the tender age of nine to pursue her dream of becoming a tennis star. She had to stay separately from her mother and moved to Florida along with her father to proceed with her training. Her father worked laboriously to fund her tennis training. Although she suffered bullying on account of being a foreigner, she never lost hope or gave in to petty remarks. Her will and determination led her to achieve success and reap satisfying results from her practice sessions. Apart from practising tennis, her hobbies are fashion, singing and dancing. Although she mentions that money is a motivating factor for playing tennis, her sole aim remains to become and continue being number one in the world of tennis.</p>
